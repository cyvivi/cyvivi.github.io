		<h1>Setting Goals for Your Site</h1>
		
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>I am very inspired by the websites for <a href="http://www.benefitcosmetics.com" target="_blank">Benefit Cosmetics</a> and <a href="http://lizz.es" target="_blank">Lizzie Seymour</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>
		<p>The <a href="http://www.benefitcosmetics.com" target="_blank">Benefit Cosmetics</a> website uses very effective hierarchy. The banner takes up a large chunk of the page and calls attention to promoted products. The eye goes next to call to action in the three columns on the bottom of the page.</p>
		<p>This website also uses a grid well. The banner disrupts the grid, creating visual interest. The call to action below is neatly organized. The number of columns varies page by page, but the width of the columns is consistent; three columns together are always the same witch as a single column.</p>
		<p><a href="http://lizz.es" target="_blank">Lizzie Seymour's</a> website also uses very effective hierarchy. The two columns work well to solve the goal of the site. She does this so well that you may not even notice the second column. She integrates it with the illustration at the bottom of the page to keep focus grounded on the first column. The framing around the page shows off the designer's skill with typography and illustration. Negative space is abundant and purposeful.</p>
		<p>The site is very responsive, going to far as to completely remove the framing and move the second column to a row at the top of the page if the screen gets too small. Also, as you scroll, the sidebar's links highlight as you reach the sorresponding section.</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>These websites aim to achieve slightly different goals with very different solutions. Benefit is selling a number of products, while Lizzie Coleman is selling her skills as a designer. Benefit achieves their goal with clear calls to action that invite the user to explore the brand and the products.  Lizzie Seymour achieves her goal by putting emphasis on the area that best shows her skills.</p>
		<p>Both websites use typography very well. Also, they both use negative space creatively. Benefit used a pattern to make the columns pop and Lizzie Seymour used a cloudy sky to tie in with the illustration.</p>
